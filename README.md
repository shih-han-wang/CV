## Shih Han Wang

- Believing coding is just like in the theatre, every story is possible to be told on the stage. It is my ambition to work as a web or apps developer in the creative industries - art events, festivals and institutions-, able to communicate expert knowledge and cultural value across the globe in a way which has a major impact.

- After working and studying in Theatre and Creative Industries Management for more than 5 years, I wanted to challenge myself to learn a new "tool" in order to merge all my previous knowledge.

- Regarding a "tool", coding is precisely what I needed after all. Thus I decided to learn to code at Makers Academy, a 16-week software development boot camp.

## Skills

#### Communication

- I’m able to simplify complex topics and deliver succinct messages. I’m comfortable presenting to all levels of the organization and collaborating with cross-functional or remote teams.
- The experience of being a stage manager in theatre trained me how to connect with all the team members and be a core channel between them.

#### Logical Thinking

- I’m detail oriented and very organised. While working as a PA, I showed accountability, dealing multiple tasks and solving problems independently.
- Also when I was working as a stage manager assistant in a big scale production, I led almost 100 theatre crews on the stage. There was no time for me to think twice about each question or any problem we met on the stage. I was able to make the decision precisely and lead the teams effectively.

#### Understanding

- The training of the actress gives me the ability to read people easily and precisely. I had experienced various lives in different patterns and been telling others' stories, thus I'm able to understand different personalities and quickly find out the motivation of individual's behaviour.
- In the meantime, I’m able to adapt myself easily to the new environment and the different teams and also keen on listening to others' opinions and understanding their positions.

#### Language in Mandarin and English

- I have been doing the play script translation from English into Mandarin for a while, which gives me the ability to find the precise word in both languages to approach the same expression.
