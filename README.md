## Skills

#### Communication & Teamwork

- Engaging & empathetic communicator. Acting training gave me the ability to read people and understand their motivations.

- Working as a stage manager for more than 10 productions. One of them I was responsible for  coordinating 11 actors and 80 back-stage staff for a run of 18 successful nights.


#### Problem Solving

- Whilst being a stage manager, I was constantly engaged in seeking new ways to achieve the goals of the production team, designers, directors and performers. 'When there's a problem coming out, find a solution and fix it.' For me, this is the most critical and transferable skill that I can take from stage management into software development.

#### Understanding

- Being an actress, I had to gain experiences of different lives in order to tell others' stories. The deep understanding of human behaviour gives me the ability to improve user interfaces and make the software more accessible to wider variety of people.
