## Skills

#### Communication

- I’m able to simplify complex topics and deliver succinct messages. I’m comfortable presenting to all levels of the organization and collaborating with cross-functional or remote teams.
- The experience of being a stage manager in theatre trained me how to connect with all the team members and be a core channel between them.

#### Understanding

- The training of the actress gives me the ability to read people easily and precisely. I had experienced various lives in different patterns and been telling others' stories, thus I'm able to understand different personalities and quickly find out the motivation of individual's behaviour.
- When I am writing programs and applications, this skill make me be able to consider deeper from the user's perspective and catch very quickly what the user —a "human being" using this app with her/his human nature— would expect.
